# Social.app
"The application topic for this exam is about a social-media 
website (i.e., a very simplified Facebook)." 

My solution is this app built with lots of cool technologies,
including these: 

* React
* React Router 
* Express
* Webpack
* Babel
* Jest
* Passport

## How to run
Be sure to install all dependencies first using

    yarn install

Social.app is available on **localhost:8080** when started using

    yarn dev
    
To run tests, use the test command

    yarn test


## Thoughts
I asked myself 48 hours ago "can I really build this solution?" ‚Äì I
was a bit skeptic. I still am, because all the requirements were not met. 
I really wish this exam lasted longer. It's a great product for learning,
but the requirements are quite huge.  
 
I have, however, learned so much from this stressful exam. I hope that
shows in this project with everything from folder structure to React
logic. Still lots to learn, but I'm happy with the progress so far.

The focus has been on building the components first and then the backend. 

I also want to stress that security in terms of backend was not my 
number 1 cause this time. My main focus has been the client and API.

Testing is something I finally realized why is important, but the
implementation here is not good enough. I'll be sure to look more into 
this for future projects. 

##### What I want to improve
* Solving all the tasks
* Live Chat for for friends
* Adding native browser notifications
* Testing. I should've taken testing more seriously this course. 
I guess I've learned.
* Search can only display exact case-insensitive matches üîç - should smarter
* For CreatePost: switch from input to textarea
* Don't return the user's password when getting a user ü§î
* Data validation
* Embedding links into chat messages
* Actually implementing the Friends feature would be fun
* Improved API design
* Implementing the YouTube API for displaying YouTube videos in the feed
* Posting on somebody else's timeline
* Showing relative time (started on this, but didn't have time to finish)
* Editing user details
* Cleaning up package.json (should be pretty good, though)
* Hosting the app
* More cool features
* Improved folder structure and use of best-practises
* Did I mention tests?

## Extra functionality
* SCSS/SASS
* Date Picker
* User Interface
* The server can serve images
* Links as attachments
* Click the user's label on a post to visit their profile
* Lots of smart conditional rendering (especially on Profile)
* Search with suggestions
* Sign out
